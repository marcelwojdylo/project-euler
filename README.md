# First 50 Project Euler problems
This repository contains my solutions for the first 50 Project Euler problems.

## What is Project Euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website created by Colin Hughes which offers a series of increasingly difficult challenges from the area of computational mathematics. 

## Is 50 problems a lot?
The website contains 671 problems of increasing difficulty. While I plan to carry on with the task of solving consecutive ones, I picked the first 50 as a good starting point for this stage of my growth as a developer. According to the website's statistics, around 5% of users have solved at least 50 problems.
